News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. It can help you answer questions like:

What top stories is TechCrunch running right now?
What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?
Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?
You can search for articles with any combination of the following criteria:

Keyword or phrase. Eg: find all articles containing the word 'Microsoft'.
Date published. Eg: find all articles published yesterday.
Source domain name. Eg: find all articles published on thenextweb.com.
Language. Eg: find all articles written in English.
You can sort the results in the following orders:

Date published
Relevancy to search keyword
Popularity of source
You need an API key to use the API - this is a unique key that identifies your requests. They're free while you're in development.
